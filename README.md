# Redundancy Calculator README
## Project Overview
XXX, referred to as XXX for confidentiality purposes, is one of the leading media companies in the UK. However, due to automation being implemented more and more within XXX,  many employee roles are no longer needed. Therefore, in order to help downsize the workforce, XXX has started offering voluntary redundancy. This initiative helps XXX to effectively restructure the organisation, while providing a financial incentive for employees who are considering leaving XXX.

To help XXX increase the awareness of voluntary redundancy among employees, I have been given the task of building an app that calculates an employee’s redundancy payout if they do agree to voluntary redundancy. This app will help employees understand their redundancy pay based on company rules as well as legal rules. The app will also help the HR department of XXX as it will reduce the amount of enquiries they get about voluntary redundancy, thus improving the department’s efficiency. 

The technology stack used in this project will include CSS for styling, HTML for structure, JavaScript for functionality, GitHub for version control and project management, Figma for design, and more.

## Project plan
When building the app I aim to use an agile approach where my work will be completed through sprints. With a redundancy calculator being a relatively simple app to design and implement, I won’t require a long project to fulfil its requirements. Therefore I feel I can implement this app in 3 two week sprints. 

Sprint 1 will focus on setting up the basic HTML structure and CSS styling as well as gathering the requirements of the app and UI design. Sprint 2 will focus on writing the rest of the HTML and implementing the calculation logic in JavaScript, and Sprint 3 will focus on optimising the styling of the app, and conducting final testing.

Each sprint will include sprint planning at the start of a sprint, where the work during the sprint will be decided, a sprint review, where work is reviewed and tested, and a sprint retrospective, where a reflection on what went well and what can be improved is conducted.

## Project management tools
During the project GitHub Projects will be used to manage the project and work done. This is because GitHub Projects enables users to manage tasks via a Kanban board, containing columns, where tasks are set as tickets, and those tickets are arranged in the columns. This project’s Kanban board will have 3 columns which are, to-do, in progress, and done. 

## Requirements
At the start of the project, requirements of the app were gathered. These requirements were split into functional and non-functional requirements. The requirements were captured and then tickets were created based on them.

The functional requirements of the app included:
